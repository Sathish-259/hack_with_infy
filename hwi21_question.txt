Swapping integers
An array will be given
We have to sort the array while sorting we have to swap two numbers at the same time we have to store the absolute difference between the numbers 
At the end of sorting we will have to return the maximum difference
Example
5 arr size
1 6 2 3 4
Output 
4
Explanation
While swapping 6 and 2 we get 4
Then between 6 and 3 we get 3
Then between 6 and 4 we get 2
Max(4,3,2)=4
